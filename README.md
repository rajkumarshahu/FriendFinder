# FriendFinder

* This is  a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

* Survey page contains 10 questions. Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

* Once the app finds the current user's most compatible friend, the result will be displayed as a modal pop-up
